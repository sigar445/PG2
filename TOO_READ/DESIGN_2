You're on the right track! Structuring a PG management system involves a clear delineation of services and functionalities. Here's a high-level approach to the Low-Level Design (LLD):

Services and Modules
Room Service:

Add Room

Remove Room

Update Room

Retrieve Room Details

Rental Service:

Pay Rent

Pay Utilities

View Payment History

Generate Invoice

Guest Service:

Add Guest

Remove Guest

Update Guest Details

Notice Period Management

Entities
Room: Represents individual rooms. Attributes might include room number, type, occupancy status, rate, etc.

Guest: Represents occupants. Attributes include guest ID, name, contact details, check-in/check-out dates, etc.

Rent: Represents payment records. Attributes include payment ID, guest ID, room ID, amount, date of payment, etc.

Utility: Represents utility payments. Attributes include utility ID, type, amount, due date, etc.

Invoice: Represents billing details for rent and utilities.

Example Class Design
java

Copy
public class Room {
    private String roomNumber;
    private String type;
    private boolean isOccupied;
    private double rate;
    // Constructors, Getters, Setters
}

public class Guest {
    private String guestId;
    private String name;
    private String contactDetails;
    private LocalDate checkInDate;
    private LocalDate checkOutDate;
    // Constructors, Getters, Setters
}

public class Rent {
    private String paymentId;
    private String guestId;
    private String roomId;
    private double amount;
    private LocalDate paymentDate;
    // Constructors, Getters, Setters
}

public class Utility {
    private String utilityId;
    private String type;
    private double amount;
    private LocalDate dueDate;
    // Constructors, Getters, Setters
}

public class Invoice {
    private String invoiceId;
    private String guestId;
    private double totalAmount;
    private LocalDate invoiceDate;
    // Constructors, Getters, Setters
}
Service Methods
java

Copy
public interface RoomService {
    void addRoom(Room room);
    void removeRoom(String roomNumber);
    void updateRoom(Room room);
    Room getRoomDetails(String roomNumber);
}

public interface RentalService {
    void payRent(Rent rent);
    void payUtility(Utility utility);
    List<Rent> getPaymentHistory(String guestId);
    Invoice generateInvoice(String guestId);
}

public interface GuestService {
    void addGuest(Guest guest);
    void removeGuest(String guestId);
    void updateGuest(Guest guest);
    void manageNoticePeriod(String guestId);
}
This LLD approach should give you a robust foundation for managing the different aspects of your PG service efficiently. Happy designing! üõ†Ô∏è
